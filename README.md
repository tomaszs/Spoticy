# Why you should choose Spoticy

Online music streaming services decide for you how you experience your music. For example, they change how random music works. They play music you listen often, instead of random songs you have collected for years. In case the service goes down, it is very hard to move to another platform with your playlists.

That is why Spoticy was born. Spoticy allows you to create your own, private music server. It comes with a built-in end-to-end encryption. So now one other will have access to your music. It is written in JavaScript, so you can improve and customize your player according to your needs. The provided connector for PHP allows you to set up server on a shared-hosting or VPN in no-time. You can also create your own connector for cloud providers or decentralized storage.

Spoticy give your freedom to:

- listen to music how you want
- where you want
- where to store your music
- easily move your music and playlists between providers
